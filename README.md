# M2_climat_MAR
Computing climate trends over the Alps with MAR forced by ERA-20C

We will download MAR data to investigate climate trends over the Alps.

For this we will use several classic Python packages:

    xarray: is an open-source project and Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun! (Xarray Tutorial / Xarray | SciPy 2020)
    jupyter: for using jupyter-notebook / lab
    matplotlib: back-end for making plots
    cartopy: replace basemap, back-end for map projections
    proplot: a lightweight matplotlib wrapper for making beautiful, publication-quality graphics (still in development)
    xesmf: Universal Regridder for Geospatial Data (only for Linux and Mac, an alternative is the interp function from xarray)

Check the Environment section at the end of this README if you want to know more about the environment and/or to install it on your local machine.
